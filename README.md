# Mr. Srinivas's Caesar Cipher Algorithm Tool

## 1. Description

Welcome to **Mr. Srinivas's Caesar Cipher Algorithm Tool**, a Python-based encryption and decryption tool that leverages the Caesar Cipher algorithm. This tool allows users to easily encrypt and decrypt messages using a shift-based cipher. The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques where each letter in the text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

## 2. Features

- Encrypt any text message using a user-defined shift value.
- Decrypt an encrypted message using the same shift value.
- Easy-to-understand instructions for both encryption and decryption processes.
- Interactive and user-friendly interface.
- Personalized messages for enhanced user experience.

## 3. Getting Started

These instructions will help you run the Caesar Cipher tool on your local machine.

## 4. Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## 5. How to Install

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mr-srinivas14/PRODIGY_CS_01.git
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is stored.
   
   ```bash
   cd PRODIGY_CS_01
   
## 6. How to Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the Python file using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher_tool.py

## 7. Usage Example

## Example 1 : Encryption

1. After running the program, youâ€™ll be prompted with:

   ```bash
   Welcome to Mr. Srinivas's Caesar Cipher Algorithm Tool.
   If you want to encrypt, enter E. If you want to decrypt, enter D:
2. Enter E to encrypt a message.
3. Enter the message and the shift value:

    ```bash
    Enter your message: Mr Srinivas
    Enter the shift value: 3
4. The tool will return:

   ```bash
   Encrypted message: Pu Vulqlydv
   You need to enter this same shift value while Decryption.
   Use this Encrypted message for Decryption.

## Example 2 : Decryption

1. If you want to decrypt, enter D at the initial prompt.
2. Enter the encrypted message and the same shift value used during encryption:

   ```bash
   Enter your message: Pu Vulqlydv
   Enter the shift value: 3
3. The tool will return:

   ```bash
   Decrypted message: Mr Srinivas
4. The program concludes with:

   ```bash
   Thanks for using Mr. Srinivas's Tool.
